          <p class="card-text">
            Ashley Graham (アシュリー・グラハム Ashurī Gurahamu?) is the daughter of former U.S. commander-in-chief President Graham. In 2004, she was briefly kidnapped and held captive by the Spanish cult Los Iluminados, as part of a scheme to hijack the United States government using the Las Plagas parasite, thus influencing the greater world into following the agenda of Osmund Saddler. After receiving insider intelligence about Ashley's whereabouts, President Graham personally deploys former US-STRATCOM agent Leon S. Kennedy to investigate the area. He discovers that the local villagers have actually been converted to their beliefs through the use of parasitic organisms known as Las Plagas. Not long after, Leon discovers that Ashley is behing held in a church on the outskirts of the village.After rescuing Ashley from her cell, the two meet with the cult leader, Osmund Saddler, who revealed that Ashley (as well as Leon) had been administered with one of the Plaga parasites, and that Saddler was planning to return Ashley to the President in order to infiltrate and command the United States government from within.
After escaping Saddler and the villagers, the two found their way into Ramón Salazar's castle, and later, into Saddler's island complex. Ashley would repeatedly be recaptured by Los Iluminados during Leon's mission and subsequently rescued each time. Within the island complex, the two found a laser surgery machine built by Luis Sera with the purpose of removing a Plaga internally from its host's body. Leon and Ashley used the machine on themselves, destroying their Plaga parasites and thus, removing Saddler's only leverage on them.

After Saddler was eliminated, Leon and Ashley made their escape from the collapsing island on a jet ski left by Ada Wong.

          <h3 class="card-title">Ada Wong</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            Ada Wong (エイダ・ウォン Eida Won?) is the pseudonym of an enigmatic unnamed spy of Asian-American descent. She has gained notoriety in the corporate world for being able to handle serious situations and the most difficult requests without guilt. Wong has acted secretly in the background of many biohazard incidents and collected information which became useful to several organisations, while at the same time operating to undermine them. However, Wong follows only her own "true purpose" and has often betrayed the organisations and customers she is affiliated with to achieve it.Wong's personal life is a complete mystery. Her ethnicity and nationality are left unconfirmed, and when and where she was born are also unknown, not to mention her birth name.

According to one account by Wong herself, she was born around 1974 to a wealthy Chinese-Vietnamese family in the Chợ Lớn district of Saigon in the final months of the Vietnam War. In the aftermath of the Fall of Saigon, persecution of the Hoa became commonplace due to class division. When she was three years old, Wong's family sold off what remained of their assets to human traffickers in order to escape to the United States, but they were ultimately cheated and arrived with no money to survive on. However, the validity of this account is questionable as Wong would later remark on this story as being fabricated to test Leon S. Kennedy's gullibility.

Early intelligence career
As a young adult, Wong became linked to several international criminal organisations and participated in missions both domestically and abroad. During one of her missions, Wong was given the task of operating within a pool of undocumented migrant workers living out of a dilapidated pig sty, and spreading highly-toxic pesticides on a potato farm.
